# Seeds for failure cases proptest has generated in the past. It is
# automatically read and these particular cases re-run before any
# novel cases are generated.
#
# It is recommended to check this file in to source control so that
# everyone who runs the test benefits from these saved cases.
#
# Historical note: The entry below originally failed when the suffix generator
# could produce punctuation without leading whitespace. The shrunk case was
# `suffix = "."`, producing `@merge-train stop.` which is NOT a valid command
# (the parser extracts "stop." as the command word). The generator was
# subsequently constrained to require leading whitespace in suffixes, so this
# seed now produces a different (valid) test case.
