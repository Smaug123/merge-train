# Seeds for failure cases proptest has generated in the past. It is
# automatically read and these particular cases re-run before any
# temporary cases.
#
# This file can be added to version control to help ensure all
# contributors end up having the same regressions check
#
# To regenerate all regression files locally, run:
# cargo test --lib -- --ignored __proptest_fallback__

# Test failure from CI
